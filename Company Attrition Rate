How this can help a business problem or help a business out:

I used SQL to analyze various metrics based on department, such as, finding the attrition rate of the company, 
which department has the highest turnover rate, which gets the most bonuses, hours worked per month, promotions and salaries.  
In these findings, it has been proven that sales employees have the highest attrition rate, however, they are also the ones with 
the most bonuses and promotions. 

Once I pulled all the information needed, I used the SQL queries to create visualizations on Tableau, such as, pie charts and bar 
charts to illustrate which department has the highest attrition rate. This allows for upper management to visually see which department
is leaving more frequently based on the salary they obtain, and then, allows for making improvements within the company based on the trends.
