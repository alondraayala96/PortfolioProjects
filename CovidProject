How does this solve pandemic problem?

I used SQL to look at the wordlwide covid cases. In this project, I looked at total cases, total deaths and vaccinations per
country. These metrics are essential to determine which countries have been infected the most. This allows for the health 
departments to make executive desisions on whether their country/region needs to require vaccinations or to implement any
other strategies to keep their region safe from covid.

Furthermore, I used Tableau to create graphs and mappings to illustrate which regions have been impacted rhe most. This allows
to visually see the percentage of the population that has been infected worldwide. This provides the health department/government
helpful insights to make ethical decisions for the communcity.
