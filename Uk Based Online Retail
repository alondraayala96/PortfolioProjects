How does this solve business problems?


First, I used SQL to calculate various customer metrics such as the top selling countries, top sold products, sales per month,
annual revenue comparison and total orders versus average order size. These metrics are essential to help identify which regions
and time of the year the business should focus its marketing and sales efforts.

Further more, I created SQL queries to generate visualizations, such as, bar charts, line charts, and maps to illustrate the distinction
of purchasing trends and their corresponding contributions to the companies revenue.

Finally, I presented the findings in a comprehensive report using Tableau, highlighting the unique characteristics of customer segements.
By doing so, the company gained valuable insights into its customers base, allowing them to tailor marketing campaigns to improve on 
retention and optimize revenue.
